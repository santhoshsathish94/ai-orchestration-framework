What this demonstrates:
  - implementation files can be written
  - existing verification files are read-only at the container boundary
  - the reference write guard resolves real paths before policy matching

For development workflows, create new tests in a writable area and promote
trusted verification artifacts into the protected boundary before using them
as evidence of Success.
